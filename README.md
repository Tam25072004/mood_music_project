# ðŸŽµ Mood-Based Music Player ðŸŽ­

This project is an AI-powered desktop application that detects your **facial emotion in real time** using your webcam and plays music that matches your current mood â€” happy, sad, angry, or neutral.

---

## ðŸ“¸ How It Works

1. Opens your webcam and scans your face.
2. Uses `DeepFace` to detect emotion (e.g., ðŸ˜ƒ Happy, ðŸ˜¢ Sad, ðŸ˜  Angry).
3. Automatically plays a corresponding `.mp3` song from a local folder using `pygame`.
